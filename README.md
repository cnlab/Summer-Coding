# Summer-Coding
A repository for the CN Lab Summer REU Students! [Work in Progress] 

## Stuff to add
- reproducibility template
  - see dani's [GITHUB](https://github.com/dcosme)
- some relevant datasets
- better t test code w/ repro markdown 
  - should explain *what* a t-test is/does and how to report 
- simple correlation markdown
  - this should explain *what* a correlation is/does and how to report 
- some simple data viz stuff. how to write simple plots
- organize all code into relevant folders
  - exploratory analyses (i.e., correlational design)
  - confirmatory analyse (i.e., stuff like t-tests)
If we want to get ambitious we can also throw in some simple NLP stuff. I think Arden and Denise will have different skillsets and we should try to cater to those best we can
